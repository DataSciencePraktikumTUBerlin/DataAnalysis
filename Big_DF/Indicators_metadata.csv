1,a_eprod,Total electricity output,GWh,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Total number of GWh generated by all power plants
2,a_econ,Total final energy consumption (TFEC),TJ,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Derived form energy balances statistics.It is equivalent to total final consumption excluding non-energy use
3,a_inten,"Energy intensity, primary energy",MJ/2011 USD PPP,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,A ratio between energy supply and gross domestic product measured at purchasing power parity. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.
4,a_sharo,Renewable share electricity output,%,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Electricity generated by power plants using renewable resources as a share of total electricity output.
